# PCBuildingVR

## Project
This project is for CS464: Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction at Colorado State University.
The goal is to design a VR based learning environment to instruct users how to build a computer via a virtual "hands-on" approach. This project will feature a Tutorial mode which will guide users through the process of building a computer while teaching them about each component. It will also feature a Freeplay mode in which the players can go at their own pace and use their own knowledge to build a computer.
This program will be constructed in Unity and is being tested on an Oculus Rift S VR headset.
