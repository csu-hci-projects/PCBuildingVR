## Setting Up Unity

* Visit the [Unity](https://store.unity.com/download) site to download the client
* Once it's done installing, select "New" and use version 2019.2.19f1
* Select 3D and use whatever project name and location
* Once the project has loaded, select "Asset Store" above the scene
* Search for "Oculus Integration" and select the free package from Oculus
* Activate it by selecting "Free" and then "Import"
* Make sure all boxes are checked, then select "Import" on the bottom right of the new window
* Select "Yes", "Restart", "Upgrade", and then "Restart"
* Then at the top select "Assets", "Import Package", "Custom Package", and then select the Unity package file from this repo
* If a scene has no object in it, download the scene file from this repo and select it in the file explorer


## Exporting Unity Project
* Select "Assets" at the top, and then "Export Package"
* Select all files, except for Oculus (too many files are in Oculus)
* It will also be helpful to upload the Scene created in case of importing failure (has been experienced already)
  * This file will be in your file explorer under (Project)/Assets/Scenes/
